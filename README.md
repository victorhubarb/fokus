## Project Description
Fokus is a task management tool that integrates a Pomodoro timer to enhance productivity and focus. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Fokus is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently while encouraging them to take regular breaks using the Pomodoro technique. The interface is clean and user-friendly, featuring a dynamic timer, customizable task lists, and soothing background music options to create a conducive work environment.

## Features and Application Demonstration
- **Dynamic Pomodoro Timer**: Includes a digital countdown timer with three selectable modes: Focus, Short Break, and Long Break. Each mode adjusts the timer and changes the interface color, text, and background image to reflect the selected mode.
  - **Focus Mode**: Sets the timer to 30 minutes for concentrated work sessions.
  - **Short Break Mode**: Sets the timer to 5 minutes, allowing for brief pauses.
  - **Long Break Mode**: Sets the timer to 15 minutes for extended downtime.
  
- **Background Music Toggle**: Users can choose to play or stop background music to enhance their focus or relaxation during the timer sessions.

- **Task Management**:
  - **Persistent Task List**: Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that user data remains intact even after the browser is closed. Users can continue where they left off without losing their task progress.
  - **Task List Creation**: Users can add tasks to an "In Progress" list, which helps track current activities aligned with the Pomodoro sessions.
  - **Editable Tasks**: Tasks can be edited on the fly with an inline editing feature, enabling users to update task descriptions easily.
  - **Task List Options**: Features options to clear completed tasks or all tasks from the list, aiding in list management and organization.
  
- **Interactive Task Entry**: Adding a new task transforms the button into a text input field with options to delete, cancel, or save the task. Saved tasks are added to the task list and can be marked as in progress.
  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that Fokus is fully functional and visually appealing on various devices, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal user experience.
