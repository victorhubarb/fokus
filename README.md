## Project Description
This project is inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, which aims to focus on important tasks. Thus, we concentrate on an activity for 25 minutes, for example, and after that period, it's possible to take a 5-minute break or opt for a longer 15-minute break. It's a simple and interactive web application that allows users to add, edit, view, and remove tasks, all in a visually pleasing and user-friendly environment.

## Features and Application Demonstration
- `Feature 1`: Adding Tasks: A magic button reveals a form where you can write and add new tasks.
- `Feature 2`: Editing Tasks: Click on an edit button, and voil√†, you can change the task description.
- `Feature 3`: Viewing Tasks: The added tasks are all there, beautifully organized, waiting for your attention.
- `Feature 4`: Marking Tasks as Complete: When a task is completed, it changes its appearance.
- `Feature 5`: Removing Tasks: Be selective and remove only completed tasks, or throw everything away and start again with a clean task list.
- `Feature 6`: LocalStorage: We rehearse the dance of storing and retrieving data using LocalStorage, keeping our tasks safe and accessible even after the browser is closed.
- `Feature 7`: Manipulating sounds and synchronizing them with the start, pause, and end of the timer.
